# Azure Kit

Azure Kit enables teams to seamlessly deploy and operate Vaadin Java-based applications built using Flow on Azure Cloud.
The Kit helps teams quickly create Vaadin apps that are scalable, highly available, and user-friendly.
The Kit is also based on Kubernetes to minimize the risk of cloud-provider lock-in.
